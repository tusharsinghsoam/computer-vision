# About

* This repository contains problems related to computer vision, solved using **SOTA Deep Learnin Models **. 

* We would try to explore several famous convolutional neural networks like VGGs, resnets, inceptions, YOLO net etc.

* Dataset sources will be mentioned in the README files of individual projects.


Feel free to collaborate or suggest any interesting project/Dataset.
